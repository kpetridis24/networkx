    Notes
    -----
    Before trying to create the mapping between the nodes of the two graphs, we must check if:
    1. The two graphs have equal number of nodes
    2. The degree sequences in the two graphs are identical
    3. The two graphs have the same label distribution. For example, if G1 has orange nodes but G2 doesn't, there's no
    point in proceeding to create a mapping.
